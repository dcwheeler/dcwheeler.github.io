    title: "Infragravity Waves"
    excerpt: "During my PhD, I worked on infragravity Wave driven boundary layer dynamics in Los Peñasquitos Lagoon, a small bar-built estuary near San Diego. I lead a field deployment focused on the impacts of infragravity waves, developed new processing techniques for calculating turbulent dissipation, and built on unsteady boundary layer theory to evaluate how infragravity waves increase bottom stress."

    title: "Academic Culture"
    excerpt: "I have always been interested in how academics can best alighn their research focus with the needs of society. During my PhD, I learned about community based research and actionable science and decided to devote a chapter of my thesis to interviewing academics about expectations in academic culture to better understand why academics find engaging with communities effectively difficult."

    title: "Ice-Ocean Interactions"
    excerpt: "Currently I am working on ice-ocean interactions at tide-water glaciers. I am using data collected from Xeitil Sít (Leconte Glacier) to understand buoyant plume dynamics along vertical ice faces and how those plumes facilitate increased glacier melt rates."

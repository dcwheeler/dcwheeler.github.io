During my PhD, I worked on infragravity wave driven boundary layer dynamics in Los Peñasquitos Lagoon, a small bar-built estuary near San Diego. Currently, I am working on ice-ocean interactions at tide-water glaciers. I am using data recently collected at Xeitil Sít (Leconte Glacier) in Alaska to understand buoyant plume dynamics along vertical ice faces and how those plumes facilitate increased glacier melt rates.

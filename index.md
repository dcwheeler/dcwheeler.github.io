    text: "Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at Tufts University. On this website you will find information on my research, my hobbies, and my various notes from past and current projects that I think might be helpful for others. I am a coastal physical oceanographer who focuses on boundary layer dynamics in a range of systems. I did my PhD at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I worked with professor Sarah Giddings on infragravity wave driven boundary layer dynamics in Los Peñasquitos Lagoon, a small bar-built estuary near San Diego. Currently, I am working with professer Becca Jackson on ice-ocean interactions at tide-water glaciers. I am using data recently collected at Xeitil Sít (Leconte Glacier) in Alaska to understand buoyant plume dynamics along vertical ice faces and how those plumes facilitate increased glacier melt rates. My work uses novel observational techniques to collect unique data, mixed with theory development and simple numerical models to advance our understanding of boundary layer dynamics in a way that helps us evaluate systems from more easily obtained measurements. I also have strong interests in community engaged research and dedicated a chapter of my PhD dissertation to better understand the competing forces that make actionable science challenging in an academic context."
